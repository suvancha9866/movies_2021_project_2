After everything that has gone\r\nthrough in our lives in the past year, movies were a great way to relax\r\nand start enjoying ourselves. 2021 was a special year for movies,\r\nespecially because this was when theaters began to open back up, and\r\npeople wanted to get out of the house and start watching movies with\r\npopcorn in their hands. I thought it would be interesting to see what\r\nmovies compelled people to come out and see cinematic pieces on the big\r\nscreen.\r\nBackground\r\nThe COVID-19 virus hit the population hard. It quarantined us for\r\nabout one and a half years. People stayed at home watching movies on\r\nstreaming services. Once August of 2021 hit, things started going slowly\r\nback to normal. Movies played a massive part in bringing people out of\r\ntheir homes and wanting to go to the theaters. It would be nice to see\r\nwhat made these movies successful.\r\nFactors\r\nIn 2021 especially, I believe that there are factors that have made\r\nsome certain movies do really well in the past year. I think that these\r\nfactors are might have a contribution in what made these movies\r\nsuccessful.\r\nThe Distribution Company: I think this may be because of\r\nmarketing and how well they could sell their movies to the public to\r\ncome out of their comfort zone and watch during such trying\r\ntimes.\r\nGenre: I think the genre of a film can entice an audience to\r\nwatch a movie. If there is a big following for a type of movie, then\r\npeople will come and watch it.\r\nRelease Date: In 2021, this one factor maybe very important.\r\nBecause COVID was still a great issue at the beginning of 2021, people\r\nwere not as likely to go out and watch a movie.\r\nConfounding things that I found while determining if a movie is\r\nsuccessful or not.\r\nData\r\nI found data about each movie’s gross dollar amount, release date,\r\nand other details about movies in 2021. I thought this data set would be\r\ninteresting to look at to dissect which movies were the greatest films\r\nof this year. I also found another data set about the genre of movies\r\nthat came out in 2021. This was a little less detailed, and there were\r\ndata sets in data sets, so I chose the most basic one to display my\r\npoint.\r\nTOP 10\r\n\r\n\r\nTop 10 Movies of 2021\r\n    Rank\r\n      Title\r\n      Gross Dollar Amount\r\n      Release Date\r\n      Distribution Company\r\n    1\r\nSpider-Man: No Way Home\r\n804793477\r\nDec 17\r\nSony Pictures Entertainment (SPE)2\r\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\r\n224543292\r\nSep 3\r\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures3\r\nVenom: Let There Be Carnage\r\n213550366\r\nOct 1\r\nSony Pictures Entertainment (SPE)4\r\nBlack Widow\r\n183651655\r\nJul 9\r\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures5\r\nF9: The Fast Saga\r\n173005945\r\nJun 25\r\nUniversal Pictures6\r\nEternals\r\n164870234\r\nNov 5\r\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures7\r\nSing 2\r\n162790990\r\nDec 22\r\nUniversal Pictures8\r\nNo Time to Die\r\n160891007\r\nOct 8\r\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)9\r\nA Quiet Place Part II\r\n160072261\r\nMay 28\r\nParamount Pictures10\r\nGhostbusters: Afterlife\r\n129360575\r\nNov 19\r\nSony Pictures Entertainment (SPE)Source: IMDb.com and Box Office Mojo\r\n    \r\n\r\nThis table shows the top 10 highest-grossing movies in the year\r\n2021.\r\nA few things to note: - No Way Home made about 4 times more than\r\nShang-Chi\r\nAll of these movies were made in the latter half of 2021\r\nThe Distribution companies are well-known companies\r\nMovies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are part of the Marvel Cinematic\r\nUniverse or somehow associated with Marvel.\r\nAlthough not listed here, Movies 1 to 6 and 8 are listed as\r\nAction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI added this graph as food for thought. It shows the percent of the\r\ntotal gross amount earned on opening day. The graph that has the lowest\r\npercentage means that it had more money made in subsequent weeks. I\r\nthought this was interesting and added it in just so it is here.\r\nFactor 1: Distribution\r\nCompany\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber of Movies the Top 10 Movies' Distribution Companies Made that ended up in the Top 10 of 2021\r\n    Distribution Company\r\n      Count\r\n    Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)\r\n1Paramount Pictures\r\n1Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE)\r\n3Universal Pictures\r\n2Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures\r\n3Source: IMDb.com and Box Office Mojo\r\n    \r\n\r\nThis is the table with all of the distribution companies in the Top\r\n10 Movies for 2021, and the number of movies they made in the top\r\n10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a graph of the gross amount of money that the top 10\r\ndistribution companies made.\r\nAnalysis:\r\nIn 2021, Sony was the Distributor that made the most money-making\r\nmovies. They made 3 movies this year that ended up in the top 10, and\r\nthey made the highest gross amount. Does this mean that if someone wants\r\na successful movie, they should go with Sony? No, that is causation. Is\r\nthere a correlation? Not really. They had a really good year with one of\r\nthe biggest films of the year. Spider-Man was heavily anticipated,\r\nbringing people out to the theaters in crowds. Strategically it was also\r\nreleased at the end of the year, meaning it was when people were more\r\ncomfortable going to the theaters. So does the distributor have an\r\nimpact on if the movie will be successful? I don’t think so.\r\nIssues Spider-Man was a very anticipated movie.\r\nPeople watched it over and over again, and people talked about for a\r\nlong time after it released. It was a reunion and nostalgic film- a\r\ngreat success for Sony. Sony doesn’t have this type of success every\r\nyear which makes this somewhat biased. That is not to say that Sony\r\nisn’t a good distributor, but this was an outlier.\r\nFactor 2: Genre\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber of Movies in 2021 According to Genre\r\n    Rank\r\n      Genre\r\n      Count\r\n    1\r\nAction\r\n452\r\nAdventure\r\n273\r\nHorror\r\n494\r\nComedy\r\n595\r\nDrama\r\n1206\r\nThriller/Suspense\r\n407\r\nMusical\r\n48\r\nDocumentary\r\n489\r\nConcert/Performance\r\n310\r\nWestern\r\n411\r\nBlack Comedy\r\n112\r\nRomantic Comedy\r\n713\r\nMultiple Genres\r\n2Source: Nash Information Services\r\n    \r\n\r\nThis table shows how many movies in 2021 were made according to the\r\ngenre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a graph about the gross amount of money each genre made. This\r\ngraph shows the action genre made. Clearly, it shows that action movies\r\nwere very desirable in 2021 beacause it made the most money.\r\nAnalysis\r\nAs we said earlier, 7 of the 10 movies in the top 10 were Action\r\nmovies. There were a lot of action movies this year compared to other\r\ngenres. This was a popular year for action movies. After a long year of\r\nCOVID, people were primarily drawn to Action and Adventure. It looks\r\nlike with the Top 10 Movies and with the most grossing genre, people\r\nlike Action movies. Does that mean that Action movies are most likely to\r\nbe successful? No, correlation doesn’t equal causation. But it is\r\npossible.\r\nFactor 3: Release Date\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can we take away from this?\r\nWe can see the blue concentration at the year’s end. This shows that\r\nto have a successful movie in 2021, it is best if it was released in the\r\nlatter part of the year.\r\nConclusion\r\nOf all the factors I have listed, the most influential ones were the\r\nRelease Dates and the Genre of the movies. They were significantly able\r\nto determine if a movie was able to be successful. Though Correlation\r\ndoesn’t equal Causation, it still can see if a movie is good or not.\r\nSure factors such as plot and acting quality matter when coming to a\r\ngood movie so we can’t rely on these three factors.\r\nIssues\r\nThis was a really good year for Marvel Movies. They released 4 movies\r\nfor their universe and had a Venom movie too. A successful franchise\r\nwith many fans, theaters were packed for these movies. James Bond and\r\nthe Fast and Furious Franchises also have grand followings, so these\r\nmovies will be successful too. Factors like popularity also play a role,\r\nso we can’t say that all Action movies will do good in this type of\r\nyear. This is some food for thought for a COVID ridden year.\r\nAnother thing was the No Way Home became very popular because of a\r\nleak. It showed that past Spider-Man actor Andrew Garfield was likely to\r\nbe in the movie. This created lots of nostalgia for older audiences and\r\nmade people come to the theaters to watch their favorite\r\nsuperheroes.\r\nThere are other factors that need to come into play such as the plot\r\nor the acting quality when it determining whether a movie was good or\r\nnot too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
