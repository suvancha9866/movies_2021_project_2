## About Me

Hello. My name is Suvan Chatakondu. I live in Aurora, Illinois and attend Metea Valley High School as a rising senior. I am really interested in Data Science.

## Goals

- Figure out what made movies successful in 2021
- What was the reason behind the movies' success?
- Learn more about data science

## URLs
For my data collection, I used two urls to determine my graphs and tables.
